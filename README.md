Omega Valley is inspired by the [Ashes of the Singularity](https://www.ashesofthesingularity.com) map [Gamma Draconis](https://wiki.ashesofthesingularity.com/index.php?title=File:Gamma_Draconis.png) for [Beyond All Reason](https://www.beyondallreason.info)

Autored by peacefighter, with the help of Beherith and suggestion from IceXuick and GayDad.

This map is made for drawing combat to the middle form both sides as a high yield of metal can be found in the mid section of the map. Requiring both teams to strive and conqueror the middle to achive victory. As leaving it to the enemy could give them a major metal advantage.
